# Roleplay Rule 6
## Do not metagame.

- Do not use [color=red]out-of-character (OOC) information[/color] to gain in-character (IC) advantages or knowledge.
- Your character should only know what they have learned through [color=green]roleplay[/color] and in-game events.

[color=red]Example[/color]
- Communicating with others in a Discord channel during combat to gain an advantage.
- Having perfect knowledge of things that would be "rare" IC such as Asakim.

[italic][color=green]Keep IC and OOC knowledge separate to ensure fair and immersive gameplay.[/color][/italic]
