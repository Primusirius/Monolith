# Conflict Rule 1
## Avoid random deathmatch (RDM).

Players must have valid in-character reasons to kill or attack another player.

- Any conflict is allowed with a [color=red][bold]proper, reasonable RP reason[/bold][/color]. A stolen magazine may be reasoning for a fistfight, but not a meatgrinder.
- Combat should arise naturally through roleplay, with proper escalation and meaningful interaction.

[italic][color=yellow]Faction Conflict:[/color][/italic]
- Faction conflict is allowed at all times, due to the RP reason of [color=red][bold]active war[/bold][/color] and other lore reasoning.

[italic][color=green]Conflict should be meaningful, and should implement proper roleplay over random violence.[/color][/italic]
